ClusterConnect
==============
This plugin allows you to connect to servers in configured clusters with a specified username.
You are able to connect to single servers in a cluster or the whole cluster.
It adds a new tab to Terminator and splits the window as needed.



If you specify groupby as true the plugin adds the new terminals to a group.
You will be able to send the same commands to all servers.
Be carful in using this feature, as you are probably typing to a lot of servers simultaneously!
Autocomplete and such should be used very carefully.
